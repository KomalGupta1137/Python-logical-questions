//Make an algorithm that takes 2 numbers as inputs from the user. Then we will multiply those numbers and print the result. Example :-, if we input 5 and 4 then 20 should be printed.

Note :-
Don't use * multiply operator to multiply , you can use any other operators like +,-).

first = 5
second = 6
i = 0
sum = 0
while i<first:
    sum = sum +second
    i +=1
print(sum)
